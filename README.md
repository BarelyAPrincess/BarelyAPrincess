### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

It is so lovely to meet you. My name is **Drs. Amelia S. Greene**.

In the vast cosmos of life, I dwell in Kansas City, Missouri, a place that's as much a mosaic of cultures and experiences as a city. My existence is a curious blend of roles and identities, each one as unique as a snowflake and together forming the intricate pattern that is me.

I am a guardian in the realm of healthcare, a place where science meets humanity. Every day, I strive to be a beacon of hope and healing, making a difference, one heartbeat at a time.

The pen, they say, is mightier than the sword. As a writer, I wield my pen to craft stories and explore worlds unseen. My words are like whispers in the wind, carrying tales of joy, sorrow, dreams, and reality. They are my melodies in the symphony of life.

In the vibrant spectrum of the LGBTQIA+ community, I stand as an ally and as a woman of transgender experience. I believe in love and freedom, in the right of every individual to be who they truly are. The rainbow, in all its radiant glory, is a testament to diversity and inclusion - values I uphold with unwavering conviction.

As a champion of women's rights, I echo the roar of the lioness, advocating for equality and justice. I dream of a world where every woman stands tall, unbound by societal chains, free to chase her dreams under the vast open sky.

In the digital realm, I am a resident geek. Like an explorer charting unknown territories, I navigate the vast landscapes of technology, eager to learn, innovate, and create.

As a GitHub Campus Expert, I'm akin to a lighthouse guiding fellow developers in the vast ocean of code. I'm here to foster a community of learning, collaboration, and innovation. Together, we are shaping the future, one line of code at a time.

#### ðŸ¤” Why do you use the professional title of doctress?
We can all agree that societal norms are quite often insanely massagist. Back in the days of... Actually, that's not worth the explanation, let's go with the TLDR: I use the title Doctress as a nod to those trailblazing women of yesteryears who defied societal norms to practice medicine. It's a title that echoes my commitment to healthcare and my deep respect for the history of women in this field.
