### 🌟 Drs. Amelia S. Greene 🌟

Hello World! 👋 Welcome to my enchanting realm of magic, where I proudly embody a walking-talking encyclopedia of "useless" information—thank my papa for that catchy slogan. ✨ I come to you from the Paris of the Plaines or, by its more boring name, Kansas City–in Missouri, which is the superior side! 😄

I am a student at the Longview Campus of Metropolitan Community College of Kansas City. 🎓 I'm pursuing an Associate's degree in Computer Science–with a twist! My peers typically focus on the usual computer-y stuff, but I've chosen to pursue an emphasis on healthcare and biological science. 🧪🧠 No one ever said empathy and algorithms couldn't go hand in hand. 🤝

I am not just an academic marvel but a literary wizard! ✨🧙‍♂️ With my pen as my wand, I conjure captivating stories that whisk you away to unseen realms, where dreams and reality mingle effortlessly. It's pure magic! ✍️ I also dabble in graphic design and editing, bringing my creative prowess to life. I even run a small publishing business in my spare time, merging my love for literary arts with my entrepreneurial spirit. 🎨📚💼

My childhood venture into computers involved mastering the art of writing the almighty Sanguis Machinae ("blood of the machine" in Latin) - AKA source code that makes computers go vrooooom! 💻 I began by learning to program in QBasic and DOS, moved to Visual Basic on Windows 2000, and finally landed on PHP, Java, Lua, Python, and C# (in that order). Programming has allowed me to weave a web with CPU threads and sculpt with C# that is sharper than the sharpest blades. ⚙️🔧

After enrolling at MCCKC, I dove into the world of hands-on experience. I earned my nurse aide certification and landed a job with The University of Kansas Health System. 💉 For the past twenty-two months (Jan 2022), I've been the ultimate doctor's shadow, lurking in the operating rooms and clinics. My academic future? I'm aiming for medical school or some other fancy specialty in biology or healthcare–which is pending a final decision soon enough. 🏥👨‍⚕️

Before I end this introduction, let me spill the beans on my humanitarian efforts. I'm a proud member and advocate of LGBTQIA+ and women's rights. 🌈💪 And let's not forget my devotion to conservationism - Mother Earth deserves our love and care, right? 🌍 Oh, and did I mention I love volunteering and penning thought-provoking social commentary articles? If that's not enough, I even try having a regular schedule of dropping mind-blowing videos on YouTube. 🎥✨

Alright, enough about me for now! I can't wait to go further on this magical journey and invite you to engage me on the social media profiles. My personal website is a great start. Until then, keep being awesome. ✨🚀

#### Q. Why do I use the doctress (Drs.) title?
A. Back in the day, before medical schools existed, practicing medicine was that "quirky hobby of playing god." Some inquisitive world-changing women proudly embraced the "doctress" title, while men used the modern "doctor." The world would soon retire the title in favor of simply using "doctor" in the same way the military uses "sir" to salute any superior, regardless of gender. With my fiery spirit and audacious ambition to become a healthcare pioneer, I resurrect the seemingly meaningless "doctress" title. It's both a playful challenge to social norms and a heartfelt tribute to the trailblazing medicine women who came before me.
